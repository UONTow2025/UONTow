						<!-- Start of turn phrase: -->
						<h2 id="content"><u>Start of turn phase:</u></h2>
						<p>
							1. Events<br />
							2. Determine Initiative for the round<br />
							3. Challenges<br />
							4. Colonial actions
						</p>
						<h4>Events</h4>
						<p>
							The GM will have a set of events and a random system will generally decide if an event occurs, and if so which one. However,
							to reflect the state of certain campaign factors like chaos corruption and undeathly energies, the randomness levels may shift.<br />
							<span class="small">Beware the Great Necromancer</span>
						</p>
						<h4>Initiative</h4>
						<p>
							In the initiative step the GM will reveal the initiative order for the turn determined from the following factors:<br />
							- +1 for top 3 performing players<br />
							- +5 for bottom 3 performing players<br />
							- +3 for neither of the above<br />
							- +1 per 2 gold spent in the initiative bid last turn.<br />
							Once the initiative order is established the GM will go through the secret naval actions of the players in initiative order.
							If initiatives are the same, a rolloff will determine order.

						</p>
						<h4>Start of turn phrase form:</h4>
						<p>
							Players may submit the form to inform DM about all pre-Game decisions for easier book keeping: <br />
							<a href="https://forms.office.com/r/cBDf4VYhVh">Link to the form</a>
						</p>
						<h4>Challenges</h4>
						<p>
							Each player must issue a challenge to another player, starting with the player with the highest initiative. The challenger and challenged must fight a game of Warhammer: The Old World in the battle phase. A player who has been challenged may not issue a challenge that round- their army is already committed to battle!

						<!-- Colonial actions phrase: -->
						<h2 id="content"><u>Colonial actions phase:</u></h2>
						<h3>
							Each player that has purchased a fleet must also decide their actions on the secondary map for the turn.
							The options here are to expand your holdings or to attempt to retrieve treasure from the sea.
						</h3>
						<h4>
							Expand colonial holdings
						</h4>
						<p>Declare an island that you wish to expand onto.</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<h4>1. Expand on a specific island</h4>
								<p>
									<b><u>If the island is unoccupied:</u></b><br />
									- <b>Only one player</b> expands on it: that player gains the island automatically.<br />
									- <b>two players</b> expand onto it they must battle for the island. The winner gains control of it.<br />
									- <b>more than two players</b> expand onto it: the players may choose to back away from the island and avoid a battle, instead performing challenges or passing the turn. If two or more players still wish to battle for the island, a battle occurs with the island in the middle of the table and ends in the submission or destruction of all opposing vessels. <br />


								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>If the island is already occupied:</u></b><br />
									- <b>one player</b> attempts to attack: a naval battle occurs. The island terrain must be placed  in the middle of no-mans-land but need not be central, use an artillery die and a scatter die to determine it’s location- but it remains on the central line.
									<br />
									- <b>Two players</b> attempt to attack: they battle each other; the winner receives a set amount of gold.
									<br />
									- <b>Three or more players</b> attempt to attack: All attackers retreat from the field. they may choose to  return to their port and skip the battle phase this turn or make challenges from the other players in this situation where gold will be rewarded to the winner.

								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>Retrieve treasure</u></b><br /><br />
									The seas of the Old World are vast and contain many great secrets, every so often a relic of these rises from the seabed or floats into the vicinity of our map. A rough image of what the curiosity is will be added to the map before the start of the turn.<br /><br />
									If only one player tries to retrieve the treasure, they must see if it is guarded. They may then choose to engage the guardians for it or retreat back to port.<br /><br />
									If two players try to retrieve the treasure, they will have a battle of Man O War to determine who takes the treasure.<br /><br />
									Should 3 or more players all try for the same treasure, players may choose to back away from the island and avoid a battle, passing the turn. If two or more players still wish to battle for the island, a battle occurs with an island with 3 treasure tokens in the middle of the table. Treasure may be seized from the middle by any ship in a turn in which they are within 1” of the island- that ship is now treated as a treasure ship from the Man o War scenarios. Any ship that leaves the table with a treasure token claims that loot. Any treasure left floating for 2 end phases sinks to the icy depths and is lost.

						<!-- Battle phase: -->
						<h2 id="content"><u>Battle phase:</u></h2>
						<h3>
							The mainland battle a player has been assigned occurs, and empire points are given to each player based on the result of their battle. Should a player end up battling multiple times in a turn for any reason, they must take the result of their first battle for victory points.
						</h3>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<h4>Empire points (EP)</h4>
								<p>
									<b>A loss</b> is worth 1 empire point<br />
									<b>A draw</b> is worth 2 empire point<br />
									<b>A narrow victory</b> is worth 3 empire point <br />
									<b>A Major victory</b> is worth 4 empire point<br />
									<b>A Massacre</b> is worth 5 empire point<br />
								</p>
								<h4>XP points</h4>
								<p>
									<b>XP points are calculated for all character units that were present in the battle. Any character not present in a battle gains 2 XP.</b><br /><br />
									<u><b>Characters gain XP for the following:</b></u><br />
									<b>Participation</b> 2 XP<br />
									<b>Survives the battle</b> 1 XP<br />
									<b>Each challenge won</b> 2 XP <br />
									<b>Each Unit killed by them or a unit they have joined</b> 2 XP<br />
									<b>Each monster they have personally slain</b> 2 XP<br />
									<b>never fell back in good order or fled</b> 2 XP (Dying before a leadership check counts as they fought to the death. Non-Unbreakable models)<br />
									<b>Unbreakable special rule did not generate wounds on themselves or a unit they joined through an unstable or daemonic instability test. </b> 2 XP<br />
								</p>
								<h4>Injuries</h4>
								<p>
									If a character was slain in the battle they must roll on the battle scars table. If they were fleeing or had fled off of the table at the end of the game, you must roll a d6. On a 4+ they escaped unharmed, on a roll of 1,2 or 3 they must also be rolled for on the battle scars table.<br /><br />

									<br />
									Please refer to the Injury table
								</p>
								<h4>Stealing Magic items</h4>
								<p>
									If a character was slain in a duel, their opponent may roll 2 d6. If the combined result is 9+, the opponent may choose to steal one magic item that character was equipped with to add to their armoury roster. This may allow players to gain access to items from other faction-specific lists. If the targeted item was built by the winner, the roll is automatically successful.

								<h4><u>Spending empire points</u></h4>
								<p>
									<b>Empire points may be spent as follows. Any unspent points may be saved up to a total of 5.</b><br /><br />
									<b>Claim Tile - 2 EP</b>  (Claim an unclaimed tile that is adjacent to one of your own tiles.)<br />
									<b>Conquer Tile - 3 EP</b> (Remove another player’s claim on a tile that is adjacent to one of yours and take it for your faction. You must have fought and won a battle against that player in the preceding battle phase)<br />
									<b>Raids - 1 EP</b>  (Add 2d6 gold to your treasury.)<br />
									It costs an additional empire point to claim or conquer a mountain tile.<br />
									It costs an additional empire point to claim or conquer a hold or castle.

								</p>


								<h4>Spending Experience Points</h4>
								<p>
									Characters may spend their XP to purchase stat boosts from the <a href="placeholder">table</a> , each character may only have each boost once. <br /><br />

									<u>Single faction specific upgrade</u><br />
									Additionally, a player may spend<b> 5 XP </b>points to access a single faction specific upgrade such as Knightly virtues, chaos gifts or chaos mutations- an amount of gold equal to the points cost must also be paid,
									and these are permanently added to the character’s sheet and points cost. <br /><br />

									<u>Character Promotion</u><br />
									For <b>15 XP </b>points a character may be promoted to the next level of their profile (such as empire captain to empire
									general). They retain all of their injuries, upgrades and experience as they become their new character- but may no longer be played as their lower points cost and inferior stat-line. If they are being promoted to their highest tier then they must have at least 2 stat upgrades from the XP table to be able to be promoted.<br /><br />

									<u>Wizard Promotion</u><br />
									For a wizard to be promoted, they must first be at the level of magic below or equal to the minimum of their promoted profile. A wizard may increase their wizard level for <b>15 XP</b>. A wizard promoting to the highest tier of their profile does not require the 2 stat upgrades as normal<br /><br />



								</p>

								<h4>Battle scar allocation</h4>
								<p>
									For any defeated characters.<br />
									Please refer to the Battle Scar Table <a href="Tables.html">Here</a><br />
									Please refer to the Major injuries Table <a href="Tables.html">Here</a><br />
									Please refer to the Psyche shifts Table <a href="Tables.html">Here</a><br />
								</p>
								<h4>Income</h4>
								<p>
									Income from all sources is totaled up and added to each player’s treasury. From the mainland this will be a sum of gold determined by the amount of tiles and mines a player has.<br />
									<b>Each Tile - 2 Gold</b> <br />
									<b>Each Mine - 5 Gold</b> <br />
									If the player has occupation of at least one island on the colonial map without a fort, they may choose to dig for treasure on one of those islands and consult the treasure table. This prevents building a fort on that island this turn.
								</p>
								<h4>Building</h4>
								<p>
									Players may spend gold to construct mines, holds and castles on the main campaign map- and forts on islands on the colonial map.<br />
									Each tile may only have a single building on it. Any building may be built on any tile.<br />
									<b>Mine</b> 10 Gold<br />
									<b>Hold</b> 20 Gold<br />
									<b>Castle</b> 1 EP + 20 Gold (Upgrade from Hold)<br />
									<b>Fort</b> 15  Gold (adds a fort to the island in a man o war battle)<br />

								</p>
								<h4>Purchasing magic items</h4>
								<p>
									For most factions, at the end of the Revenue phase the gold amassed from mines and events may be spent to purchase magic items from either your faction-specific lists or from the Magic items section of the Main rulebook. Each gold piece translates to 1 point towards any item. Items gained in this manner are added to your armoury, and can be allocated to any characters present in a battle in the way magic items usually are. Essentially you create your own roster of  magic items available to your faction. Each Player may only build any non common item once.
									<br />
									Dwarf players still do not have access to standard magical items through this mechanic, but instead may create runic items for their faction. To create a runic item, first a name must be given to the item. Runes may be imbued onto the item through the spending of gold. . Each gold piece translates to 1 point towards any rune added to an item. Each item must be unique, and each item is subject to the standard runic limitations. E.g. Only one master rune etc. Each of these runic items may be added to during the armoury step, and form a roster like any other factions- a character in a dwarf army may draw runic items from this roster. Dwarfs may use non-runic
								</p>
								<h4>Gaining VP</h4>
								<p>
									If a player completes a faction objective, they must inform the GM at this stage so it may be logged on the secret victory spreadsheet. These are not yet finalised and some may affect the events stage or add things to a faction. Eg. Nagash will grow in power as his artifacts are gathered, which may affect the events phase.

								<h2>Diplomacy</h2>
								<p>
									Rather than setting rules for diplomacy, it is up to players to decide if they share information or form truces/alliances. Gold may be spent in any negotiation to sweeten deals. Any alliance or truce made is only as binding as the participants honour.
