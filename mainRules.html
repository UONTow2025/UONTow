						<h2 id="content"><u>Start of turn phrase:</u></h2>
						<p>
							1. Events<br />
							2. Determine Initiative for the round<br />
							3. Challenges<br />
							4. Colonial actions
						</p>
						<h4>Events</h4>
						<p>
							The GM will have a set of events and a random system will generally decide if an event occurs, and if so which one. However,
							to reflect the state of certain campaign factors like chaos corruption and undeathly energies, the randomness levels may shift.<br />
							<span class="small">Beware the Great Necromancer</span>
						</p>
						<h4>Initiative</h4>
						<p>
							In the initiative step the GM will reveal the initiative order for the turn determined from the following factors:<br />
							- +1 for top 3 performing players<br />
							- +5 for bottom 3 performing players<br />
							- +3 for neither of the above<br />
							- +1 per 2 gold spent in the initiative bid last turn.<br />
							Once the initiative order is established the GM will go through the secret naval actions of the players in initiative order.
							If initiatives are the same, a rolloff will determine order.

						</p>
						<h4>Start of turn phrase form:</h4>
						<p>
							Players may submit the form to inform DM about all pre-Game decisions for easier book keeping: <br />
							<a href="https://forms.office.com/r/cBDf4VYhVh">Link to the form</a>
						</p>
						<h4>Challenges</h4>
						<p>
							Each player must issue a challenge to another player, starting with the player with the highest initiative. The challenger and challenged must fight a game of Warhammer: The Old World in the battle phase. A player who has been challenged may not issue a challenge that round- their army is already committed to battle!

						<!-- Colonial actions phrase: -->
						<h2 id="content"><u>Colonial actions phrase:</u></h2>
						<h3>
							Each player that has purchased a fleet must also decide their actions on the secondary map for the turn.
							The options here are to expand your holdings or to attempt to retrieve treasure from the sea.
						</h3>
						<h4>
							Expand colonial holdings
						</h4>
						<p>Declare an island that you wish to expand onto.</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<h4>1. Expand on a specific island</h4>
								<p>
									<b><u>If the island is unoccupied:</u></b><br />
									- <b>Only one player</b> expands on it: that player gains the island automatically.<br />
									- <b>two players</b> expand onto it they must battle for the island. The winner gains control of it.<br />
									- <b>more than two players</b> expand onto it: the players may choose to back away from the island and avoid a battle, instead performing challenges or passing the turn. If two or more players still wish to battle for the island, a battle occurs with the island in the middle of the table and ends in the submission or destruction of all opposing vessels. <br />


								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>If the island is already occupied:</u></b><br />
									- <b>one player</b> attempts to attack: a naval battle occurs. The island terrain must be placed  in the middle of no-mans-land but need not be central, use an artillery die and a scatter die to determine it’s location- but it remains on the central line.
									<br />
									- <b>Two players</b> attempt to attack: they battle each other; the winner receives a set amount of gold.
									<br />
									- <b>Three or more players</b> attempt to attack: All attackers retreat from the field. they may choose to  return to their port and skip the battle phase this turn or make challenges from the other players in this situation where gold will be rewarded to the winner.

								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>Retrieve treasure</u></b><br /><br />
									The seas of the Old World are vast and contain many great secrets, every so often a relic of these rises from the seabed or floats into the vicinity of our map. A rough image of what the curiosity is will be added to the map before the start of the turn.<br /><br />
									If only one player tries to retrieve the treasure, they must see if it is guarded. They may then choose to engage the guardians for it or retreat back to port.<br /><br />
									If two players try to retrieve the treasure, they will have a battle of Man O War to determine who takes the treasure.<br /><br />
									Should 3 or more players all try for the same treasure, players may choose to back away from the island and avoid a battle, passing the turn. If two or more players still wish to battle for the island, a battle occurs with an island with 3 treasure tokens in the middle of the table. Treasure may be seized from the middle by any ship in a turn in which they are within 1” of the island- that ship is now treated as a treasure ship from the Man o War scenarios. Any ship that leaves the table with a treasure token claims that loot. Any treasure left floating for 2 end phases sinks to the icy depths and is lost.

						<!-- Battle phase: -->
						<h2 id="content"><u>Battle phase:</u></h2>
						<h3>
							The mainland battle a player has been assigned occurs, and empire points are given to each player based on the result of their battle. Should a player end up battling multiple times in a turn for any reason, they must take the result of their first battle for victory points.
						</h3>
						
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<h4>Empire points (EP)</h4>
								<p>
									<b>A loss</b> is worth 1 empire point<br />
									<b>A draw</b> is worth 2 empire point<br />
									<b>A narrow victory</b> is worth 3 empire point <br />
									<b>A Major victory</b> is worth 4 empire point<br />
									<b>A Massacre</b> is worth 5 empire point<br />
								</p>
								<h4>XP points</h4>
								<p>
									<b>XP points are calculated for all character units that were present in the battle. Any character not present in a battle gains 2 XP.</b><br /><br />
									<u><b>Characters gain XP for the following:</b></u><br />
									<b>Participation</b> 2 XP<br />
									<b>Survives the battle</b> 1 XP<br />
									<b>Each challenge won</b> 2 XP <br />
									<b>Each Unit killed by them or a unit they have joined</b> 2 XP<br />
									<b>Each monster they have personally slain</b> 2 XP<br />
									<b>never fell back in good order or fled</b> 2 XP (Dying before a leadership check counts as they fought to the death. Non-Unbreakable models)<br />
									<b>Unbreakable special rule did not generate wounds on themselves or a unit they joined through an unstable or daemonic instability test. </b> 2 XP<br />
								</p>
								<h4>Injuries</h4>
								<p>
									If a character was slain in the battle they must roll on the battle scars table. If they were fleeing or had fled off of the table at the end of the game, you must roll a d6. On a 4+ they escaped unharmed, on a roll of 1,2 or 3 they must also be rolled for on the battle scars table.<br /><br />
									If a character was slain in a duel, their opponent may roll 2 d6. If the combined result is 9+, the opponent may choose to steal one magic item that character was equipped with to add to their armoury roster. This may allow players to gain access to items from other faction-specific lists. If the targeted item was built by the winner, the roll is automatically successful.
									<br />
									Please refer to the Injury table
