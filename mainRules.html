						<h3>Each player inform the DM/ bookKeeper one of the below action in secret. There will be a microsoft form for this every week.</h3>
						<h4>
							1. Expand on a specific island<br />
							2. Blockade mainland port<br />
							3. Defend
						</h4>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<h4>1. Expand on a specific island</h4>
								<p>
									<b><u>If the island is unoccupied:</u></b><br />
									- Only one player expands on it: that player gains the island automatically.<br />
									- More than two players attempt to expand: nothing happens, as all parties retreat when there are multiple opponents.<br />
									- Exactly two players attempt to expand on the same island a Man o' War naval battle occurs.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>If the island is already occupied:</u></b><br />
									- Only one player attempts to attack: a naval battle occurs.<br />
									- Two players attempt to attack: they battle each other; the winner receives a set amount of gold.<br />
									- Three or more players attempt to attack: nothing happens.
								</p>

								<h4>2. Blockade Mainland port</h4>
								<p>
									- If the defending player chooses to defend the specified port, a naval battle occurs.<br />
									- If the defender does not defend, roll a D6 to determine blockade effects (refer to Blockade Table).<br />
									- If two or more players choose to blockade the same port, roll dice to determine who attacks. The winner of the roll fights the defender in a naval battle.
								</p>
								<h4>3. Defend</h4>
								<p>
									The player may station their fleet in a port of their choice for the turn. Unless they lose a blockade battle that same turn, that port cannot be the target of a port-to-port land battle (see Mainland Phase for details).
