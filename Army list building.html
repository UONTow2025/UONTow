					<h2>Character Roster</h2>
					<p>
						Each player is expected to create a roster of characters over the course of the campaign to reflect the growing stories and experience of their characters as the campaign progresses. At the beginning of the campaign, players will have the option to create up to 3 characters. With each passing battle a player may generate an additional character to their roster, up to 9. They are purchased at the lowest level (such as empire captain rather than general). These characters may progress to the higher levels of their profile through the XP progression scheme.
						<br />
						The player is expected to communicate any changes to their character roster to the GM before the next weeks event phase.
					</p>

					<h2>Mercenaries</h2>
					<p>

						Character mercenaries may be purchased and added to a mercenary roster- and must be paid a retaining fee while maintained on the roster. They can gain XP and have paid upgrades/ tattoo runes added to them as though they were owned characters. If the retaining fee is not paid/cannot be paid, the character is removed from the roster and is added to the communal mercenary roster. Their upgrades will be reflected in their new price.<br />
						For standard mercenaries, a cost of 20% of their points cost in gold pieces can be paid before a battle to bring them.
						For character mercenaries, such as a Doomseeker, 20% of their points (rounded upwards) in gold must be paid to add them to the roster. Their upkeep is 5% of their points cost in gold at the end of each revenue phase (rounded downwards). Upgrades such as runic tattoos can be added to them at half of their gold-cost.
