								<h2>Nicky's Realmborne Legion (Warriors of Chaos)</h2>
								<p>
									<b>Lead by General Haarkon the Fell-Hand</b><br /><br />
									In the far-north of the frozen wastes amidst the Kurgan tribes, a champion of Chaos challenges his lord. From his forebearer's broken body erupts a display of the fickle nature of their Cruel Masters, a tangle of flesh and bone, tooth and maw. The Champion's bloodied fist gnarls and sprouts twisted bone - thus is he marked by the Gods. Such stirring of Chaos is surely an omen, and so the most faithful of his tribe gather, his old master chained in tow, on bloody pilgrimage to ravage the South in the name of The Four.

								<h2>Will's The Hæwen Toll (Vampire Counts)</h2>
								<p>
									<b>Lead by Telvido, Prince of Gramarye</b><br /><br />
									Ancient shades called by a possessed Necromancer, who serves the Great Necromancer.<br />
									<details>
										<summary>Hæwen Toll Full Lore</summary>

										Whence Thuringwethil came, none knew, but she was cunning and cruel, and had gained the loyalty of some lesser vampires and necromancers. Of her, some said that she was one of Abhorash’s get cursed by the Lord of Change, and some that she was the product of one of the foul experiments of the Necrarchs, and others that she was the firstborn daughter of Xian Ha Feng, son of the Dragon Emperor, who from blighted Nehekhara returned to usurp his father. Long had she heard rumours of the Helm of Telvido, and she desired to raise a legion of wraiths with its powers, and descend upon the Empire and slake her thirst. Among her followers was a necromancer by the name of Minyon, who had amassed a great knowledge of the Wasteland, and those who had long ago lived there.<br /><br />

										In the annals of history are they named the Trinovantes, but in the beginning they named themselves the Gedhnosse, the wise, for in even those ancient days were they distinguished by their knowledge of things that are and were in this world, and their knowledge of the winds of magic, and their yearning to know yet more. It was said by some that they were distant kin to the Endals, and by some that they were exiles of the fair land of Albittia, and they clung to their meagre existence in the marshes and islands of the Wasteland and the Sea of Claws.<br /><br />
										...And it came to pass, when yet the Jutones inhabited the Nordland, that some among them desired so greatly to learn the tales of all peoples, and the names of all that flew and swam; and they began to extend their natural lifespans through magic both benign and malign, and many of their proudest and greatest took their first steps towards the path of immortality, and thus began the ruin of the Gedhnosse.<br /><br />
										...Nagash, whatever he may have believed in his hubris, was not the first practitioner of the dark art of Necromancy, though he was undoubtedly its greatest; and long after he was laid low by the Fellblade a traveller arrived in the islands of the Gedhnosse who claimed to have the mastery of life and death, and bore with him the knowledge of lost Nehekhara, and ruined Mourkain, and a thousand shadowy places which light quails to reveal besides.<br /><br />
										By now the Gedhnosse had become a diminished people, for the desire for life eternal had corrupted them, and it withered each of them while they were yet newborn.<br /><br />

										Kings made barrows more splendid than their palaces, and forsook the present for the promise of eternity. Childless lords sat in decaying halls, waiting in vain their mortal span to begin their lives. Scholars and wise men grew distrustful and hoarded their knowledge, so that the tombs of the dead contained mail finer than the houses of princes; all became lost to dreams of high towers that could ask questions of even the cold stars; their lands grew thick with gheists and wraiths of their own making, their waters choked with foul magic, and they named themselves the Trinovantes, the ever-vigourous.<br /><br />
										King Telvido received the traveller, and bade him name the price of his knowledge, but Telvido held the price too steep, and in his cunning and foolishness wrought from the traveller a gift. To the Kings of the Trinovantes was given the Helm of Telvido, which gave them a measure of command over the shades that infested their lands, and mastery of the shades of all the kings that had donned the helm before, though no shade of Telvido was ever called forth.<br /><br />
										When Sigmar welded together the Empire they were passed by, for by their kin the Endals had they been forgotten in their long isolation, and so twisted were they, and so shrouded in the mists of their sorcery, that none save them could survive in their lands.<br /><br />
										...When the Great Necromancer rose to claim the Crown of Sorcery from Sigmar the Trinovantes followed in his wake, for they had been visited by the emissary of Nagash, and King Thu swore himself and his seven heirs to the service of Nagash. In his folly, fearing that should he fall his get might prove false, he gave forth his spirit before its time, and bound the Helm to the service of Nagash also, and as was the custom did the Helm pass to his youngest son. So did Turafoc assume the rule of the Trinovantes, and he unearthed their vast barrows, and marshalled their legion of shades, and outfitted his warriors, and they boarded great leviathans of bone and marrow, and the Trinovantes went to war.<br /><br />
										One by one did the Children of Thu don the Helm, and one by one were six of them slain, Turafoc by flame and Dyrmod by shaft, Cyrefin by spear and Cranthor by chariot, and Celecormë by sword, and Mydhros by his own hand.<br /><br />
										...And it is said that when Nagash had been laid low, Makarë, last of the sons, returned to their ancestral lands, and beheld the utter ruin of the Trinovantes, and the defeat beyond redress of all their houses; for their graves had been emptied and their people slain, and such was the land scoured that all traces of a once great people had vanished. Filled with torment and lamentation he went forth alone, and none might restrain him; and in despair he wrenched the Helm from his head, and cast it into the sea, and thereafter remained, keening in sorrow and regret, within the mists besides the shore.<br /><br />
										For an age did the Helm rest upon a stony bed, until its foul magics bestirred the current and brought it to land; and there it called out to all practitioners of Necromancy, and to it was drawn the retinue of Thuringwethil. Not being rash, Thuringwethil commanded forth Minyon to retrieve it; and Minyon grasped the helm, and placed it upon his head, and thereafter did Telvido, Prince of Gramarye, arise. The first of the shades of the Trinovantes was called forth, and the building of the fortress of Hrimdûn commenced, and the dark designs of the Hæwen Toll began.<br /><br />

									<b>Lead by Kkra'goth the Wound which Walks</b><br />
									<details>
										<summary>The Martyr Arabella's Vengeance Crusade Full Lore</summary>

										<p>
											<br>
											<b>Kkra'goth</b> was a nameless shard, a simple bloodletter.<br>
											Yet his rage outshone his legion, and his hate a forge of ruin.<br>
											Thus did the <b>God of Blood</b> favour him with a chariot of blood.<br>
											He leads his red siblings, the <b>Plague Legions</b> come unbidden, drawn by the scent of death.<br>
											To these he gives neither greeting nor denial, for decay and slaughter are but two mouths of the same hunger.<br>
											And he speaks thus: The <b>Blood God</b> cares not from whence the blood flows. All rivers return to him.<br>
											He will become greater and spread the greedy arms of <b>Chaos</b>, spilling blood and collecting skulls.<br>
											He will ascend.

									<b>Lead by Doombringer's Daughter</b><br />
									<details>
										<summary>The Martyr Arabella's Vengeance Crusade Full Lore</summary>

										After the fall of the Grand Procession of the Azure and Gold in the Southlands seasons ago, the prophetess Arabella, the Doombringer, sacrificed herself chanelling her radiant might to save the rest of the surviving pilgrims. Returning to Bretonnia battered both in body and pride, the knights lamented until a strange figure who called herself "Doombringer's Daughter" pushed them to take the Exile's Vow to cleanse themselves of their sin of failure, march onto the growing chaos of the imperial heartlands, and bring the wrath of the Lady and the martyred Arabella upon the heathens who would drag all to ruin, purposely or not. First, gather allies and arms in Marienburg and promise to help restore order under their claimant. Then, the crusade must spread. For Bretonnia!

								<h2>Himmy's Azure Sky Junk Expeditionary Fleet (Cathay)</h2>
								<p>
									<b>Led by Admiral Qin Yingxin, “Shadow-Heart of the Azure Sea”</b><br />
									<details>
										<summary>The Azure Sky Junk Expeditionary Fleet Full Lore</summary>
										<br />
										<h5>
											Led by Admiral Qin Yingxin, “Shadow-Heart of the Azure Sea”
										</h5>
										Beneath a banner of Crane and Compass—a pale sea-crane circling a jade luopan—sails the most unlikely blade in Cathay’s arsenal: a fleet that wins wars with routes and contracts before a single cannon speaks. Its commander, Admiral Qin Yingxin, is soft-voiced and spare with smiles, a woman whose presence steadies a deck like ballast. The sailors call her Shadow-Heart. In storm or starlight, when fear climbs the rigging, she stands at the prow with an obsidian sextant that seems to drink the dark and murmur back the way.
										<br /><br /><br />
										<h5>
											Origins of the Shadow-Heart
										</h5>
										<br />
										Qin was born in Yenmen Plume Harbor, an inlet where fog hangs like old silk and every child can read the tide before their letters. Orphaned early, she apprenticed to the Astral Institute as a night cartographer—one of the shadowed few who correct maps by candle and star, who understand that an empire’s borders are only as strong as its sea-lanes.
										<br />
										In the Black Current Winter, a squall rose from a horizon without a moon. Three merchant junks were swallowed in minutes; a fourth would have followed, had Qin not seized the helm and used her sextant to thread a path by a scatter of half-seen reflections. Survivors swore a veil like night itself fell around the deck, drinking the enemy’s arrows and hiding the ship from the worst of the waves. A superstition was born; a reputation was earned. The name “Shadow-Heart” crossed wharves and tea-houses until it reached the Jade Court.
										<br />
										The Court did not waste a myth. They placed in Qin’s hands a consecrated Jade Luopan, bade her knit together long-hull sky junks, swift cloud-skiffs, and deep-keeled dragon-back cruisers, and charged her with a three-edged task: explore, trade, guard. Thus the Azure Sky Junk Expeditionary Fleet took water and oath.
										<br /><br />
										<h5>
											The Fleet and Its Ways
										</h5>
										<br />
										The fleet moves like a caravan wrapped in canvas and salt: factors and scribes among marines; surveyors drinking ink beside gunners who drink fire. Cloud-skiffs scout ahead through shoals and reef-mazes. Jade-ribbed junks carry the market—spice, tea bricks, silk bolts, cold iron, and the small luxuries that turn foreign harbors friendly. Dragon-back cruisers form the shadowed hand behind the handshake, their hulls braced to break rams and their decks lashed with swivel guns and repeating crossbows.
										<br />
										Qin teaches that a route is a blade you sharpen with each safe voyage. Her fleet sails with a merchant’s patience and a predator’s economy. When a port city eyes Cathay with suspicion, the Azure Fleet arrives not with ultimata but with credit notes, repair crews, and medical tents. They rebuild a pier. They sell grain at fair price while the monsoon sulks. They sign harbor agreements that braid security fees to tolls and storage rights. By the time rival corsairs arrive, the city’s warehouses hum on Cathayan schedules and its freebooters prefer the fleet’s coin to their captain’s orders.

								<h2>Leo's The Gorefrost Coven (Beastmen Brayherds)</h2>
								<p>
									<b>Lead by Twin Shamans Orthün and Frelka</b><br /><br />
									Born under the pale frost moon, the Gorefrost Coven is led by twin sibling Shamans Orthün and Frelka who have brought the warherds and foul magics of the covens south from the icy woods surrounding Mount Hellspire on a gruesome pilgrimage to cover the South in brutal winter.
									<br /><br />
									Mutating and corrupting the wildlife and nature of the region into icy horrors as the ground beneath them slowly turns to black-ice, the Coven follows the whimsy of their God-Moon and whatever temptations it leads them to as they seek to fulfil their dark pact.
									<br /><br />
									They care not for the follies and petty arguments of those warm blooded and unmarred by the harsh North as they land upon these Southern Shores.

								<h2>Lizzie's Silver Spears of Anaklusmos (High Elf Realms)</h2>
								<p>
									<b>Lead by General Calathris Thrice-Struck</b><br /><br />
									The smallest of the fleets of Lothern, The Spears of Anaklusmos are an elite fighting force consisting of the best and brightest to come out the Naval Academies, famous world over for their use of Merwyrms and Skycutters to hammer the foe whilst the Sea Guard clove them apart.
									<br /><br />
									That is they were. Fighting in the War of the Beards, they sailed against the first of the dwarven ironclads. Try as they might, the black powder weaponry and thick plate proved too much and the entire fleet was declared sunk and lost.
									<br /><br />
									Now, under the leadership of their new Admiral Calathris Thrice-Struck, the Lord of Lothern have reinstated the fleet under new banners, and the Spears reborn sail to the shores of the Old World to regain lost honour and show foes old and new that although the tides of fate ebb and flow, the oceans are not yet empty of the gleaming sails of the Eldar.

									<details>
										<summary>Silver Spears of Anaklusmos Full Lore</summary>
										With much fanfare and pomp, the silverships glided out of the harbours of the Lothern
										pennants and banners flying in the errant breeze. This was to be it, claimed the propoganda,
										the resurgance of elven superiority in the Old Lands. And leading the charge would be the
										newly reinstated Silver Spears of Anakulumos under the leaderhip of Admiral Calathris
										Thrice-Struck.<br /><br />

										As the ships entered through the open waters, naught was awry adn the journey to
										the Old World was uneventful, save for the emergance of an ancient Merwyrm. A goliath of
										aquatic muscle, they are cousins to the first leviathans who dwelt in the deep waters before
										the coming of the Ancients. It was a good omen indeed, for such creatures have oft allied
										with the Elves, their bulk belying a fierce intellegence which rivaled that of great sages.
										Twas not until the fleet drew close to the land known in the mon'keigh tongue as
										Ostland, that disaster struck. A typhoon, larger and fiercer than any aboard, even the most
										veteran of the Guard had faced. The clouds fell upon the fleet like hammer upon an anvil,
										the rain was a hail of arrows. Worst still, the winds themselves tore through the decks,
										tearing sails and carrying sailors to an untimely demise in the raging waters. A cabal of
										Storm Weavers, those wizards who by choice or appointment had been seconded to the Sea
										Guard, began a Chant of Cessation and Calming, attempting to corral the broiling winds of
										magic into maintainable streams. For but a moment, the winds obliged, the rain slowing to a
										drizzle and even a spear of sunlight shone through the disappating clouds. Yet it would not
										hold. With an unholy shriek, the winds burst free, turning to rage once more. Even more
										alarmed, the group begun the chant anew, the more novice amoungst them near comatose
										from the effort. But try as they might, the storm would not quieten, nor the winds slow. Then,
										as if peturbed by their intrusion, the souce of the storm manifested. At first, it was the image
										of a courtly woman, draped in finery but pale as if seperated somehow. However, as its focus
										shifted to the supposed intruders, the visage began to warp. Its mouth opened impossibly
										wide alike to that of a silent scream and the flesh sloughed off to reveal a ghostly skull. A
										bony hand reached out, now cloaked only in tattered embalming cloths. It made a grasping
										motion, then drew the fist tight. At once, the wizards fell to their knees, clawing at invisable
										ropes at their throats, the very breath of life stolen from them.<br /><br />

										Amoungst the now dead, a single figure remained standing. High Wizard Lord Glorfin
										N'del rose from his stoop, the shattered remains of a purple crystal fell from his hand. An
										Opal Amulet, a gift from his beloved, now lie broken on the deck, having absorbed the worse
										of the curse. Wailing in frustration, the spectre lashed out, and in his weakened state Glorfin
										closed his eyes in anticipation of death.<br /><br />

										But the blow did not land. Opening his eyes, N'del was dazed by the golden ligh that
										now washhed over the deck. Wiping his eyes to clear the haze, he saw the source of both
										the light and his salvation. A figure stood, clad in crystalline armour and a cloak that hung
										from his shoulders which flowed over his plate like that of water over a cliffside. His sword
										was raised in a defensive guard position, the blade steaming from the contact with the
										un-flesh of the ghoul. Calathris. Thrice-Struck. The admiral shifted, charging at the
										malfeasance, cloak billowing in the torrent. To Glorfin, no sight was more beautiful. The
										motion as Calathris bowed and weaved under and around the spectre's attacks, a wry smile
										on his face. That smile, that damned smile. Glorfi knew it well. It was the same that had
										shone from the light of a lumenbug as they told ghost stories, that had been wrought whist
										they studied for their exams at Hoeth. Or was it that smile as he led him up the ivory stair at
										the western tower of his family home, where they spent a night making sweet love under the
										cresent moonlight? The night had been cold in the autumnal weather, but the touch of his
										slender form and his caress had warmed him greatly, just as the memory warmed his soul.
										The memory flowed over him now and he relished it. For near 2 centuries he had been
										husband and lover to Calathris and everyday, every memory of shared moments and love
										was as clear as glacial water and as bright as the Flame of the Eternal Phenoix, a fragment
										of holy fire which watched over their union and in which their Cha'nusoiel, the binding blade,
										was forged, the very blade his husband now bore. And how he wielded it! In his hands, the
										Cha'nusoiel was a blur, the blade of ebony and wraithbone spun and twirled in his grip,
										turned to a whirlwind of beautiful destruction.<br /><br />

										Following the thought, Glorfin mind snapped back to the present. Drawing his own
										sword, he ran forward to join the melee. As he joined the combat, he fell into the rhythm of
										Khaine, bloodlust tempered by discipline, rage metered by cold logic. Such was their
										connection, Glorfin matched Calathris' movements perfectly, eachh step mirrored. He
										summoned motes of fire and ice, the magic stripping the form of the spectre, forcing it
										off-balance until finally the tip of Cha'nusoiel caught something more solid. Sensing that this
										was the focal point and anchor of the ghoul, Glorfin unleashed a shot of High magic, forcing
										the sliver wider as Calathris struck the point home, the blade sinking deep into the ghostly
										form. A last piercing wail erupted from the conjurations throat as it was ripped back beyond
										the veil. Exhausted from the exertion of so much magika, Glorfin collapsed into Calathris's
										arms, his blue eyes meeting the emerald green of his husband under the eagle-fashioned
										helm.<br /><br />

										"Well met, meleth nin." Calathris's voice was a rich baritone, washing over Glorfin like a hot
										bath, "I see you have still not found your sea legs." Blushing fiercely, Glorfin attempted to
										rise, leaning on hhis lover's arm.<br /><br />

										"I fell for you all those years ago, would it not be evident that I would do so again, even in a
										literal sense?" he jibed, though there was no malice in it. Calathris laughed, a rare
										occurence, and drew Glorfin close. Their lips met, the mingled scent of blood and sweat
										seemingly doing naught to temper their passion. The embrace would have lasted an eternity
										were it not for the interuption of the bosun. A older elf, the bosun had served aboard naval
										vessels for much of his life, yet it was not beneath him to afford his lord certain liberties
										afforded by the office he served. Still, he cleared his throat loudly, causing the two lovers to
										seperate, both mildly blushing to have been caught in an inimate act.<br /><br />

										"Far from it be my position, but I must inform milord that the storm has passed, yet we have
										suffered heavy damage. We have reports that each ship has lost at least a third of their crew,
										and all of the sails rasied have been torn to ribbons." Having given his report, the bosun
										waited whilst his master stood, afixing his cloak in the proper manner, "Very good Elbereth,"
										Calathris said, recovering his noble status, "Have we enough materials to repair the sails
										here, or must we return to dock? I do not wish to return under such circumstances, but if
										needs must then we shall." "No, milord, we can repair most damage here, and we can make
										safe harbour a few miles down the coast." replied the bosun, signalling to his repairmen to
										begin work. "Excellent! It brightens my heart to see that our quest is not yet wholy in...."
										Calathris begun, but his attention was averted to a confrontation occuring near the bow of
										the ship, where two Guardsmen had leveled spears at a dark cloaked individual. The guards
										spoke a challenge, asking the stranger whho he was and what bussiness he had aboard the
										Admiral's ship, but the stranger gave no answer but to draw two blades and dash forward.
										The blades were angular and wicked-looking, no artifice of goodly folk. As the stranger ran,
										he swiped at the guardsmen. Neither recieved a deep wound, but as the edge touched them,
										they fell like husks, skin pale and taut about their bones. The alarm began to rang but it was
										too late. The stranger leapt across the middeck, and weary from the spectre, Calathris could
										not raise his guard in time. The blade flew from the assassin's hand, flying under Glorfin's
										hurried arm, plunging into Calathris' chest. The admiral collapsed, clutching the blade that
										pierced his lung. The assassin, its work done, flipped off the deck, disappearing into the
										water's surface. All of which was unnoticed by Glorfin, who fell to his knees beside Calathris,
										weeping over the pale corpse. His hands covered his face as he howled in anguish, his nails
										cutting into his skin and releasing rivulets of blood that ran down hi face like crimson tears.
										Screaming his denial, Glorfin reached inside for that knowledge, forbidden knowlege,
										that which long ago he had stood before the Council of Elders and sworn never again to use.
										Deep in his soul, Glorfin reached for the magiks of Shyish, those spells which could cleave
										soul to body once more. Placing both hands over his husband's heart, he began the Rite of
										Returning. Ghostly tendrils snaked over the body, and the ar took on a sickly green hue. On
										the port side of the ship, the water began to spin, gradually forming a whirlpool. The torrent
										was leashed around a portal that glowed pale green, the energy leaking from it turning the
										stomachs of many of the sailors. From the portal, a single soul, gleaming white struggled to
										gain lift as if fighing a great force before leaping from the gateway and settling above the
										corpse of Calathris. It sunk into the chest of the dead admiral, and with a heaving breath,
										Calathris returned to life, his eyes fluttering open before he collapsed into unconciousness.
										Glorfin, greatly gladdened by the return of his closest kin, attempted to reverse the spell, yet
										the portal resisted his touch. he realised with dawning horror, that whilst, in his grief, he had
										opened the door, something else was now clawing its way through.<br /><br />

										As if to answer his question, a huge shape materialised from the portal before it
										snapped shut. A Necropolis, hulking vessel of the worshippers and defilers of Death, the
										servants of Nagash. In the wake of the ship's arrival, many of the sailors wnt instantly mad,
										even their elven psyches shattered by the cold, necromantic pressure. In their delusion,
										many turned on one another, and each elven vessel fell to bloody infighting, with many sunk

										<h2>Hamzah's Host of Tyr Eolith (Wood Elves)</h2>
										<p>
											<b>Lead by Lord Vaelon the Wanderer</b><br /><br />
											As the high elves return to the old world after their millennia in retreat upon ulthuan, Prince Istarion summons a royal army to be assembled and travel west, to scour the ancient Elven colonies of their ancestors, and recover any relics or priceless ithilmar within.
											<br /><br />
											The Asur of Ulthuan will surely covet such artefacts, yet they cannot be allowed to reclaim them, nor the lesser races of the world corrupt them to their own ends. The Ulthuani claim to our ancestors craft was abandoned when they abandoned the old world.

								<h2>James's The Illustrious Company of the Grass Snake (Empire)</h2>
								<p>
									<b>Lead by Ernst 'Grass Snake' Grasfelder</b><br /><br />
									The Illustrious Company of the Grass Snake is a mercenary company, formed from second sons of second sons, misguided nobles and those seeking gold and the chance at glory. Currently headed by the titular Ernst ‘Grass Snake’ Grasfelder, they sell their services to lords and princes in need of an army to stave off threats to their kingdom, earning their keep in brutal border skirmishes, rebuking orc waaghs, or standing against the rampaging forces of Chaos, whatever form they may take. Ernst earnt his name from an uncanny ability to survive the worst of situations on a battlefield, seemingly disappearing like a snake into the grass, before returning at a crucial point, reinforcements in tow. He is joined by other wandering nobles, such as those cast out for their attunement to magic, brash behaviors, or for having brought shame upon their house.
