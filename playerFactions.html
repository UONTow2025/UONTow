								<h2>Will's The Hæwen Toll (Vampire Counts)</h2>
								<p>
									<b>Lead by Telvido, Prince of Gramarye</b><br /><br />
									Ancient shades called by a possessed Necromancer, who serves the Great Necromancer.<br /><br />

								</p>
								<hr class="major" />
								<h2>Leo's The Gorefrost Coven (Beastmen Brayherds)</h2>
								<p>
									<b>Lead by Twin Shamans Orthün and Frelka</b><br /><br />
									Born under the pale frost moon, the Gorefrost Coven is led by twin sibling Shamans Orthün and Frelka who have brought the warherds and foul magics of the covens south from the icy woods surrounding Mount Hellspire on a gruesome pilgrimage to cover the South in brutal winter.
									<br /><br />
									Mutating and corrupting the wildlife and nature of the region into icy horrors as the ground beneath them slowly turns to black-ice, the Coven follows the whimsy of their God-Moon and whatever temptations it leads them to as they seek to fulfil their dark pact.
									<br /><br />
									They care not for the follies and petty arguments of those warm blooded and unmarred by the harsh North as they land upon these Southern Shores.

								</p>

								<h2>Lizzie's Silver Spears of Anaklusmos (High Elf Realms)</h2>
								<p>
									<b>Lead by General Calathris Thrice-Struck</b><br /><br />
									The smallest of the fleets of Lothern, The Spears of Anaklusmos are an elite fighting force consisting of the best and brightest to come out the Naval Academies, famous world over for their use of Merwyrms and Skycutters to hammer the foe whilst the Sea Guard clove them apart.
									<br /><br />
									That is they were. Fighting in the War of the Beards, they sailed against the first of the dwarven ironclads. Try as they might, the black powder weaponry and thick plate proved too much and the entire fleet was declared sunk and lost.
									<br /><br />
									Now, under the leadership of their new Admiral Calathris Thrice-Struck, the Lord of Lothern have reinstated the fleet under new banners, and the Spears reborn sail to the shores of the Old World to regain lost honour and show foes old and new that although the tides of fate ebb and flow, the oceans are not yet empty of the gleaming sails of the Eldar.

								</p>

								<h2>Hamzah's Host of Tyr Eolith (Wood Elves)</h2>
								<p>
									<b>Lead by Lord Vaelon the Wanderer</b><br /><br />
									As the high elves return to the old world after their millennia in retreat upon ulthuan, Prince Istarion summons a royal army to be assembled and travel west, to scour the ancient Elven colonies of their ancestors, and recover any relics or priceless ithilmar within.
									<br /><br />
									The Asur of Ulthuan will surely covet such artefacts, yet they cannot be allowed to reclaim them, nor the lesser races of the world corrupt them to their own ends. The Ulthuani claim to our ancestors craft was abandoned when they abandoned the old world.

								</p>

								<hr class="major" />

								<h2>Connor's The Grand Army of Middenheim (Empire)</h2>
								<p>
									<b>Lead by Count Boris III</b><br /><br />
									As the great threat of chaos rises and threats run rampant throughout The Empire, the great city of Middenheim stands a stalwart beacon of resistance. From this storied city the Graf leads his people to retake the province of Middenland, and push back against the tide.
